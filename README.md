# FaceApi-PoC

Simple Console App to test a few features of the Face API.  Most of the code comes from the documentation.

To make it work: 
  1) Replace the subscription key with your own
  2) Download the sample images from https://github.com/Microsoft/Cognitive-Face-Windows/tree/master/Data
     and replace the path in the app.
